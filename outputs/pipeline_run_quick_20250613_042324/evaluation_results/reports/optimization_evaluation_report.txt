EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
----------------------------------------
The genetic algorithm optimization FAILED TO improve bus schedule efficiency while adhering to all operational constraints.

KEY IMPROVEMENTS ACHIEVED:
• Occupancy rate reduced by -39.2%
• Overcrowding incidents reduced by -51.7%
• Peak occupancy reduced from 199.0% to 3128.0%
• Conservation ratio maintained at 0.960
